            Jupiter has dense clouds that consist of frozen crystals that contain ammonia and methane.
            Jupiter is named for the King of Gods because it is the biggest planet. 
            Did you know that Jupiter has a mass that is 318 times more than Earth? 
            Jupiter has 16 satellites.
            The four largest moons are called the Galilean Satellites. 
            I hope you learned a lot about Jupiter.

        <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource ParagraphArticleBody}">
            Yes, Pluto really is a planet.
            A planet is a special term applied to the larger members of our solar system that follow two rules.
            Rule 1: a planet must orbit the sun.
            Rule 2: it must be large enough that its own gravity is strong enough to maintain a spherical shape.
            There are certain properties we expect to see in a planet, such as an atmosphere and dynamic, active surfaces at some stage in their history.
            Pluto is far too big to behave anything like the tiny chunks of ice we call comets.
            No, Pluto is not an asteroid.
            Pluto is not a comet, either.
            Scientists say Pluto is a planet.

            Be smart and don't start to smoke.
            Did you know women who smoke have at least a 10 times greater likelihood of lung cancer than non-smoking women?
            Between 1960 and 1990, the death rate among women who smoke increased by more than 400%.
            Smoking by women in the United States is associated with almost as many deaths from heart disease as from deaths from lung cancer, more than 61,000 each year. 
            Each year, about 8,000 women die from strokes attributable to smoking.
            Look at all the things that could happen if you smoke.
            Before you start a deadly habit, stop smoking!

            Smoking is very wrong. 
            It affects your heart, brain, bloodstream and other parts of your body. 
            It's possible to get diseases from smoking and you can even die.
            A lot of people these days are beginning to smoke.
            That's because they don't care what cigarettes do to their bodies.
            They think it makes them cool.
            Well, they're so wrong.
            Smoking can turn your lungs black and make it hard to breathe.
            You should make good choices. 
            Don't smoke, someone loves you.

        <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource ParagraphArticleBody}">
            The rings around planets are very interesting.
            They are made of ice and meteors.
            Saturn has the largest ring system in our solar system.
            It is made up of over 20 different rings.
            Rings are usually around gassy planets.
            For example, Saturn and Jupiter are both gassy planets and both of those planets have rings.
            Also, rings are always around outer planets - for example, Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter and Saturn.
            The rings around planets are very interesting.

            I want to inform 4th graders about the Hubble Space Telescope.
            I interviewed my dad. 
            He works at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).
            The Hubble Space Telescope is a telescope built by NASA that is in orbit around the Earth.
            They put it in orbit because it has a much clearer view of the universe from there.
            The Hubble Space Telescope is about the size of a school bus and was launched April 24, 1990. 
            The telescope has not come down, and is still floating in orbit.
            The telescope takes pictures of planetary nebula, stellar dust, supernovas, and galaxies.
            It can take pictures from long distance.
            For example, it can take images of objects millions of light years from Earth.
            The Hubble Space Telescope travels 276 miles per minute around the Earth.
            As you can see, the Hubble Space Telescope is important for us to understand our Earth and the universe.

            A lot of people in Hammond Elementary School think homework is boring. 
            Ashlee is one of these people. 
            "It is just too easy," she says.
            Kirstan thinks homework rots your brain.
            Other people think it is enjoyable and fun.
            Homework is study you have to do outside of your classroom at home at 3:30 or in the evening.
            My sister Christine thinks homework can be fun or boring or even frustrating.
            She thinks homework is important because you have to study for class so you get a good grade. Christine says, "You have to practice to be good at something."
            She also says that homework teaches you a lot of things like math and social studies.
            Finally, Christine said, "Yes, we really need homework."

            Students from Hammond Elementary School are being distracted by fingerboards when given directions by teachers. 
            It's all happening here at Hammond.
            I've done a survey on fingerboards in school.
            All the boys in my class say fingerboards should be allowed in class, with the exception of Morgan; he doesn't think they should.
            Our teacher thinks the toys shouldn't even be brought into school, and most of the other teachers do too.
            So kids what should we do?
