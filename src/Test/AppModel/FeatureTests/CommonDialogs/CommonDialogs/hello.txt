Vizzini: I can't compete with you physically, and you're no match for my brains. 

Westley: You're that smart?

Vizzini: Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a man would reach for what he was given. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.  You would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

Westley: You've made your decision, then? 
Vizzini: I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. 
Westley: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. 
Vizzini: Wait till I get going! 
[pause] 
Vizzini: Where was I?

Vizzini: You only think I guessed wrong - that's what's so funny. I switched glasses when your back was turned. Ha-ha. You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. Hahahahahah.
