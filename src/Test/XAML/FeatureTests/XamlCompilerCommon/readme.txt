* Files under the Proxies folder come from $Personal\bchapman\JupiterCompilerCore\CodeGenInspect\Proxies. These are proxies to the XamlCompilerCore including the Harvester/DOM etc.
* Microsoft.Xaml.Tools.dll and Microsoft.Xaml.Tools.Silverlight are from the XamlToolkit. These are required for the SilverlightSchemaContext
* XamlCompilerCore.dll is the compiler core (product code). This should be removed once the product code is checked into the WPF branch.
