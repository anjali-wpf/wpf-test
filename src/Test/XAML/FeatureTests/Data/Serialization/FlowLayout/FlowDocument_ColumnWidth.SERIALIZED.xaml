      <Paragraph>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- Only this and nothing more."</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each <Run FontWeight="Bold">separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I</Run> wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- Nameless here for evermore.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Then the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, " 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door- Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;- This it is and nothing more."</Paragraph>
