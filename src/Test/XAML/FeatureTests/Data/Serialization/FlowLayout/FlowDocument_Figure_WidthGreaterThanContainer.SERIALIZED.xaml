  <Paragraph>Pit vipers detect prey using a two-chambered pit organ located between the eye and the nostril on each side of the head. Warm-blooded animals give off thermal radiation even when motionless. The snake's brain identifies this heat by comparing the temperatures in the outer and inner chambers. Since the brain distinguishes between input from the right and left pit organs, the snake can tell where the heat source is in relation to itself. It can strike accurately, even in the dark, at prey a fraction of a degree warmer. <Figure Margin="10,10,10,10" Width="600" Background="#FF90EE90"><Paragraph FontSize="18">This is a Figure that is wider than the containing Paragraph.
