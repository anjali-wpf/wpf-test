        </Figure> Some text around the Figure. Before Marte popped his head in there, <Bold>Ozzie Guillen</Bold> had a nice little rotation with Takatsu and Hermanson switching off every other day. Marte struggled to record his second save of the season Sunday, but Guillen chose to stick with him even though he had Takatsu warmed up in the pen. That shows the manager's confidence in Shingo has diminished in recent weeks.</Paragraph>
