      </Paragraph.Style>This paper addresses the probltem of detecting collisions of very fltexiblte objects, such as clothes with almost rigid bodies, such as human bodies. In our method, collision avoidance consists of creating a very thin force field around the obstaclte surface to avoid collisions. This force field acts like a shield rejecting the points. This volume is divided into small contiguous non-overlapped cells which compltetely surround the surface. As soon as a point enters into a cell, a repulsive force is applied. The direction and the magnitude of this force are dependent on the velocities, the normals and the distance between the point and the surface. Particular cases are discussed with the ways of solving them.</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>Computer Animation has become more and more interdisciplinary and now uses techniques from very different areas such as art, robotics or cinema. For several years, animators have used models with littlte consideration for the physical laws which drive the real world. Most of the time, animation sequences have showed geometric and rigid objects moving and changing according to simplte or compltex predefined transformations. These traditional methods have become tedious and even unablte to recreate the simpltest realistic effects.</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>In the last five years, researchers in Computer Animation have proved that only physics-based animation laws may efficiently simulate the laws of nature. Almost all natural phenomena can be modelted with differential equations. Now the question is: how to find suitablte models and stablte and efficient numerical methods for solving the equations.</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>The use of these methods not only improves the realism of motion, but also it reduces the work of the animator by introducing automatic motion control. However, the systems are often difficult to control and the constraints which are used tend to make the systems unstablte. Moreover, the numerical methods require a lot of CPU time. Fortunately, in Computer Animation we are more interested in the appearance than in a strict simulation of the motion. Consequently, it is possiblte to accept compromises and heuristic methods can be introduced, which do not change the look of the animation.</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>For several years, our research has dealt with human animation. In particular, we have introduced operators, callted JLD operators (Magnenat Thalmann and Thalmann 1987; Magnenat Thalmann et al. 1988) to automatically adapt the human body to the skelteton. However, clothes were simulated as a part of the body with no autonomous motion. Two separate probltems have to be solved for cloth animation: the motion of the cloth without collision detection and the collision detection of the cloth with the body and with itself. The first probltem was addressed by Weil (1986) and Terzopoulos et al (1987). Kunii and Gotoda (1990) have solved the probltem of garment wrinklte formation.</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>A fltexiblte or deformablte object is different from a rigid object because it cannot be computed from a small set of its points. The fltexiblte object must be divided into small parts and each point submitted to a set of local and global constraints. These constraints create forces which prevent the violation of these constraints. Solving the dynamic system requires finding an equilibrium between all these forces. Collision detection adds extra constraints and requires a specific algorithm. For very fltexiblte objects like clothes, it is necessary to solve self-collisions. Moore and Wilhelms (1988) have described a method to solve collision detection for fltexiblte objects composed of polygons. Van Herzen et al. (1990) developed an algorithm to detect geometric collisions betweeb pairs of time-dependent parametric surfaces. Our method is a modification of the Moore-Wilhelms method for processing dynamic cases like clothes on a body during a walking animation. Let us review this method.</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>Consider two non-parametric objects A and B with triangular facets. We have to detect points of A which come into collision with the facets of B during a certain period of time. The displacement volume of a trianglte is limited by the edges and the line segments corresponding to the paths of the three points P0, P1 and P2 in the directions V0, V1 and V2 (see Fig.1). This volume is compared with the path of the point P in the direction V. The intersection is found by solving the equation:</Paragraph>

          </Paragraph.Style>An exact solution of Equation (1) implies that points follow exactly the directions defined by the direction vectors. In a dynamic model, V and Vi correspond to the velocity vectors of points P and Pi. Unfortunately, when the differential equation system is solvec numerically, the velocities at t=0 are not the only parameters involved in the calculation of the new position of the points. Forces modify the velocity direction and magnitudes when t varies from 0 to tmax. In this case, a point may go across a triangle without being detected (see Fig.2). One way of solving this problem is to increase the range of u, v and t when an intersection is considered. However, several intersection triangles are obtained for a point and this makes the calculation of the force more complex. Moreover, there are cases where it is not sufficient to circumvent the problem. It would be possible to perform the intersection test after calculation of the new positions and repeat again, taking into account forces until there are no more intersections. This is timeconsuming when there are numerous intersections and a infinite loop can even occur if there are a very large number of intersections in a short time. For example, the intersection of a cloth with the human body implies several hundreds of simultaneous collisions.</Paragraph>
