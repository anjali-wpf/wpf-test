        <Paragraph>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- Only this and nothing more."</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- Nameless here for evermore.</Paragraph>
