        What is Avalon?

Avalon is the next-generation platform for Windows client applications. It combines the best features of the web such as ease of deployment and rich mix of application and content with the power of the Win32 development platform to enable developers to build a new breed of applications that are robust and take real advantage of the connectivity, storage and graphical capabilities of the modern PC.  Avalon is not just about User Interface and Rich Graphics although that is an important part, the overarching goal of Avalon is that it offer a common managed code exposure to all the capabilities of the Personal Computer including storage, communications, documents, multimedia etc. 
 
Avalon is the future Windows client platform for .NET embracing the benefits of managed code and security that the .NET framework provides. Avalon will be available for Windows 2000 and later, there will be no support for the Win9x family of operating systems as this is a forward looking platform investment. Some functionality in Avalon may be specific to take advantage of Longhorn Operating System features. Applications that run on the Avalon platform can choose to be deployed and installed on the client machine to run standalone or deployed to servers to run within the browser similar to HTML pages today.
